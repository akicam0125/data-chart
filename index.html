    <!-- STORY -->
    NEW YORK, NY --- Labor organizing and unionization efforts have taken center stage in recent months, especially in the media and entertainment industry. Workers have been pushing to create better contracts and unionize in several newsrooms, and have been met with victories. Most notable include the Buzzfeed News' union winning voluntary recognition in 2019. Vox Media also won a similar suit months prior. </p>

    <p>According to a recent investigation by the Poynter Institute, 90% of unionization campaigns in the media industry over the past several years have been successful. This victory can be visualized through the stable unionization membership rate in the media, arts and recreation industries, with rates hovering in the 5.5 to 4.8 percent range and not decreasing. This volatility is a stark contrast to other industries like transportation, which has experienced a steady decline: 20% of workers were unionized in 2010 and has steadily dropped to 16.1 percent in 2019. </p>

    <p>Experts atrribute the realtively stable rate of union membership in the media and entertainment to a variety of factors. "In journalism, there certainly with a younger generation... there has been a thrust of unionizing," said Ellen Dichner, Distinguished Lecturer at the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies.</p>
    <p>Another reason for unionization rates can be credited to shrinking newsrooms. Ironically, with local papers shuttering left and right, journalists and media industry players are stretched thin with growing responsibilities and workloads. Forming unions is one tactical step against exploitation and creating reasonable boundaries for workers.</P>
